Finding Heavy Traffic Indicators on I-94

In this project, we tried to find a few indicators of heavy traffic on the I-94 Interstate highway. We managed to find two types of indicators:

Time indicators
The traffic is usually heavier during warm months (March–October) compared to cold months (November–February).
The traffic is usually heavier on business days compared to the weekends.
On business days, the rush hours are around 7 and 16.

Weather indicators
Shower snow
Light rain and snow
Proximity thunderstorm with drizzle

It's not clear why these weather types have the highest average traffic values — this is bad weather, but not that bad. Perhaps more people take their cars out of the garage when the weather is bad instead of riding a bike or walking.
